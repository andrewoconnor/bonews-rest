              :message "Anyone else get this yet? I've been having an absolute blast so far. They really toned down the empire-management side of things (no more squalor, food etcetera), which I think is unfortunate, but the battles are great and the way the factions play off each other is excellent.<br />
                      <br />
                      Lotta people have been complaining of agent spam by the AI, but I haven't seen too much of that, luckily.<br />
                      <br />
                      I'm currently on a campaign as the Vampires and have been pretty much rolling everyone from the first turn on, but even so, the way the campaign map is structured means that you're never truly safe and the loss of just one major army (or even just one Legendary Lord) can be devastating, as you can never afford to have more than 3-4 full stacks in the field. It keeps things exciting and makes almost every battle feel meaningful.<br />
                      <br />
                      Also I can't tell if this game takes itself really seriously or is making fun of it's own rediculousness, which is a big plus for me!",
